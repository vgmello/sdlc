# Docker Permissions Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

Users were encountering the following error when trying to run the SDLC tool:

```
docker: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Head "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/_ping": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
Error: Process completed with exit code 126.
```

This occurred because:
1. The GitHub Actions runner (running in a Docker container) couldn't access the Docker socket
2. The `runner` user inside the container didn't have permission to access `/var/run/docker.sock`
3. Different host environments (macOS, Linux) have different Docker socket permissions
4. No pre-flight checks were performed to detect permission issues before running workflows

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Early Detection - Pre-flight Permission Checks

Added `check_docker_permissions()` function that runs before setup and start operations:

```bash
# Checks performed:
‚úì Docker daemon is running
‚úì User can run Docker commands without sudo
‚úì Docker socket exists and is accessible
```

If checks fail, users get clear error messages with remediation steps.

### 2. Interactive Diagnostic Tool

Added `./sdlc.sh --fix-permissions` command that:

- **Detects the platform** (macOS vs Linux)
- **Checks Docker installation** and daemon status
- **Verifies user permissions** to run Docker commands
- **Tests Docker socket access** from within a container
- **Provides platform-specific guidance:**
  - macOS: Instructions for Docker Desktop
  - Linux: Commands to add user to docker group
- **Offers automated fixes** (on Linux, can automatically add user to docker group)

### 3. Runtime Docker Group Permission Handling

Modified `entrypoint.sh` to dynamically fix Docker socket permissions at runtime:

```bash
# At container startup:
1. Detect the Docker socket GID from the host
2. Create or identify a group with matching GID inside the container
3. Add the runner user to that group
4. Verify Docker access before proceeding
```

This handles the GID mismatch between host and container automatically.

### 4. Container Configuration Updates

Updated `Dockerfile` to:

- Install `sudo` package
- Grant runner user limited sudo access for:
  - `/usr/sbin/groupadd` - Creating docker group
  - `/usr/sbin/usermod` - Adding user to docker group
  - `/usr/bin/docker` - Running Docker commands

This allows the entrypoint script to fix permissions dynamically.

### 5. Documentation Updates

Updated `README.md` with:

- New quick start step recommending permission check first
- Troubleshooting section for Docker permission issues
- Platform-specific guidance (macOS vs Linux)
- Clear examples of common issues and solutions

## Usage

### For New Users

```bash
# 1. First, check Docker permissions
./sdlc.sh --fix-permissions

# 2. If all checks pass, proceed with setup
./sdlc.sh --setup

# 3. Start the runners
./sdlc.sh
```

### For Users with Permission Issues

```bash
# Run the diagnostic tool
./sdlc.sh --fix-permissions

# Follow the platform-specific guidance provided
# On Linux, it can automatically fix permissions
```

### What the Fix Tool Shows

Example output on a properly configured system:

```

Your Docker setup is properly configured for SDLC.
You can now run: ./sdlc.sh --setup
```

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### macOS (Docker Desktop)

- Checks if Docker Desktop is running
- Verifies Docker socket accessibility
- Provides guidance to restart Docker Desktop if needed
- Usually works automatically with proper Docker Desktop installation

### Linux

- Checks if Docker service is running
- Verifies user is in docker group
- Can automatically add user to docker group with sudo
- Provides commands to start Docker service if needed
- Reminds user to log out/in or run `newgrp docker`

## Technical Details

### Runtime Permission Handling

The `entrypoint.sh` script uses this approach:

```bash
# Get GID of docker socket on host
DOCKER_SOCK_GID=$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)

# Create/find group with matching GID
getent group "$DOCKER_SOCK_GID" || groupadd -g "$DOCKER_SOCK_GID" docker

# Add runner to group
usermod -aG "$DOCKER_GROUP_NAME" runner

# Verify access
docker ps > /dev/null 2>&1
```

This ensures the runner user can access the Docker socket regardless of the host's docker group GID.

### Why This Works

1. **GID Matching**: The container's group GID matches the host's Docker socket GID
2. **No Hardcoding**: Works across different environments with different GIDs
3. **Minimal Privileges**: Only grants necessary sudo permissions
4. **Verification**: Tests Docker access before proceeding

## Benefits

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

1. **Auto-detection of Docker alternatives** (Colima, Rancher Desktop, Podman)
2. **Integration tests** for permission scenarios
3. **Automated recovery** in GitHub Actions workflows
4. **Telemetry** to understand common failure patterns
5. **Alternative runner modes** (native, DinD, rootless)

## Files Modified
