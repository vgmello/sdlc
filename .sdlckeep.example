# .sdlckeep - Files to preserve during SDLC updates
#
# This file specifies which files should NOT be overwritten when running
# the SDLC installer/updater. This is useful for preserving custom configurations,
# extra agents, or other customizations.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to .sdlckeep:  cp .sdlckeep.example .sdlckeep
#   2. Add file patterns (one per line) that should be preserved
#   3. Commit .sdlckeep to share preservation settings with your team
#
# Pattern matching:
#   - Use exact file paths relative to repository root
#   - Glob patterns are supported (e.g., *.sh, .github/sdlc/agents/*)
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#
# Examples:
# .github/sdlc/claude-system-prompt.md    # Preserve custom system prompt
# .github/sdlc/my-custom-agent.sh         # Preserve custom agent
# .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml       # Preserve custom workflow
